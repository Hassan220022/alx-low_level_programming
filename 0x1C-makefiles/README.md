# 0x1C. C - Makefiles

## Description

This project focuses on the creation and utilization of Makefiles in C programming, facilitating the compilation process. The project was completed under strict conditions with auto-reviews launching at the deadline to ensure adherence to best practices and learning objectives.

### Learning Objectives

After completing this project, you should be able to explain, without assistance:

- The purpose and use of Makefiles.
- How to define rules in a Makefile.
- The difference between explicit and implicit rules.
- How to declare and use variables within Makefiles.

### Mandatory Tasks

1. **Simple Makefile**: Create a Makefile that compiles a `school` executable using `gcc`.
2. **Using Variables**: Enhance the Makefile to use variables for the compiler and source files.
3. **Pattern Rules**: Further develop the Makefile to utilize pattern rules and automatic variables.
4. **Phony Targets**: Implement phony targets to manage `.o` and executable files effectively.

### Optional Tasks

5. **Clean Up**: Introduce cleaning commands to tidy up object files and executables.

## Requirements

- **Environment**: Ubuntu 20.04 LTS
- **Compiler**: gcc 9.3.0
- **Make Version**: GNU Make 4.2.1
- **Allowed Editors**: vi, vim, emacs
- **Files should end with a new line**
