# 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## Learning Objectives
At the end of this project, you are expected to be able to explain to anyone, without the help of Google:

### General
- What is a search algorithm
- What is a linear search
- What is a binary search
- What is the best search algorithm to use depending on your needs

## Requirements
### General
- Allowed editors: vi, vim, emacs
- All files will be compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using gcc, using the options -Wall -Werror -Wextra -pedantic -std=gnu89
- All files should end with a new line
- A README.md file, at the root of the folder of the project, is mandatory
- Your code should use the Betty style. It will be checked using betty-style.pl and betty-doc.pl
- You are not allowed to use global variables
- No more than 5 functions per file
- You are only allowed to use the printf function of the standard library
- The prototypes of all your functions should be included in your header file called search_algos.h
- Don't forget to push your header file
- All your header files should be include guarded
